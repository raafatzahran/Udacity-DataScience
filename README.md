# Data Scientist Nanodegree*

This repository contains the code developed for the [Data Scientist Nanodegree][competition]. It's written in **Python**, some in the form
of **Jupyter Notebooks**, and other in pure Python 3.

# Launching the notebook server

To start a notebook server, enter [jupyter notebook] in your terminal or console. This will start the server in the directory you ran the command in. That means any notebook files will be saved in that directory. Typically you'd want to start the server in the directory where your notebooks live. However, you can navigate through your file system to where the notebooks are.

When you run the command (try it yourself!), the server home should open in your browser. By default, the notebook server runs at http://localhost:8888. If you aren't familiar with this, localhost means your computer and 8888 is the port the server is communicating on. As long as the server is still running, you can always come back to it by going to http://localhost:8888 in your browser.
