# Data Scientist Nanodegree*

This repository contains the code developed for the [Data Scientist Nanodegree][competition]. It's written in **Python**, some in the form
of **Jupyter Notebooks**, and other in pure Python 3.

# Program Structure and Schedule

To complete this first term of the Data Scientist Nanodegree, you must successfully complete three projects. The lesson content provided before each project will assist you in understanding the concepts and mastering the skills related to each of these projects. However, you do not need to complete all of the content or quizzes, just the projects.

Below are the project due dates for each of the projects in the program, and some helpful things to know about the schedule and structure:

The end of term deadline is the hard deadline in the term. By the term end, you need to have passed the three projects to have successfully completed this term.
Project due dates are suggestions, not hard deadlines. There's no penalty for submitting late projects. However, we strongly encourage you to stay on pace. You'll benefit from progressing with your classmates, and we see that students who submit the first two projects on time have a much higher chance of completing the program.
If a student has not passed all three projects by the end of term deadline, they will have to re-enroll with the next class of students for the full term price.
Below are the suggested deadlines for each project:
**For the Class that Began on June 26:**
Project	Suggested Due Date
 - Finding Donors Project for CharityML	    July 17
 - Image Classifier Application	            September 1
 - Create Customer Segments with Avarto	    September 22
 - Final End of Term Deadline               October 6

# Launching the notebook server

To start a notebook server, enter [jupyter notebook] in your terminal or console. This will start the server in the directory you ran the command in. That means any notebook files will be saved in that directory. Typically you'd want to start the server in the directory where your notebooks live. However, you can navigate through your file system to where the notebooks are.

When you run the command (try it yourself!), the server home should open in your browser. By default, the notebook server runs at http://localhost:8888. If you aren't familiar with this, localhost means your computer and 8888 is the port the server is communicating on. As long as the server is still running, you can always come back to it by going to http://localhost:8888 in your browser.
